I am going for a simple minimalist webpage design,with a logo as the central object in the navbar. The navbar will have navitems to both sides of the logo to balance the top
Underneath the navbar will be a big self portrait picture as the landing to greet visitors with a brief introduction of myself and hobbies.

The problems i encountered related to content to put on the website to advertise. I initially wanted to exibit a software project i was working on and an android application i was developing along with personal photos of my hobbies but none of those projects where completed as of the time of publishing this website. 
I used stock photos instead for the home page, dropped an innitially planned "Projects" page and instead put in an "interest" section on the home page that was initially supposed to exibit projects that linked to the projects page.
Inspiration for my website came from https://www.byrosanna.co.uk, https://www.lucierosedonlan.com and https://www.gnomon.edu .
